# AidTrace

AidTrace is an open-source infrastructure composed of protocols and tools for **verifiable transparency in humanitarian aid**.

We empower humanitarian organizations to **prove impact with tamper-evident evidence**, while preserving their independence, identity, and relationships with donors.

## What Problem Does AidTrace Solve?

Humanitarian giving often depends on trust without verifiable proof:

- Donors cannot trace funds end-to-end (from donation to final impact).
- Reporting is frequently manual, slow, and difficult to audit.
- Multiple organizations struggle to coordinate on a shared, verifiable record.
- Beneficiaries may lack access to traditional banking and reliable connectivity.

AidTrace addresses these gaps by enabling **donation → milestones → evidence → impact** to be recorded and verified through cryptographic proofs.

## What AidTrace Is (and Is Not)

**AidTrace is NOT an NGO.**  
**AidTrace does NOT decide who receives aid.**  
**AidTrace is NOT a fundraising platform competing with NGOs.**

AidTrace is **neutral infrastructure** that organizations can integrate into their existing operations to increase transparency, efficiency, and trust.

## Core Principles

- **Transparency by design**
- **Dignity and safety for beneficiaries**
- **Neutrality and independence**
- **Trust built on evidence, not promises**
- **Sensitive data stays off-chain**

---

## How It Works (High-Level)

AidTrace is designed around milestone-based accountability:

1. **A donor contributes** (preferably using stablecoins).
2. Funds are held under **rules** (e.g., restricted usage, milestone-based release).
3. The organization submits **evidence** for each milestone (invoices, delivery proofs, reports).
4. Evidence is stored **off-chain**, while a **cryptographic hash** is anchored for verification.
5. Upon verification, funds can be released to the correct party (e.g., approved suppliers).

This enables verifiable traceability without exposing personal or sensitive beneficiary data.

## Initial MVP Focus

**Milestone-based humanitarian food aid campaigns** with verifiable proofs:

- Milestone 1: Procurement (invoice + proof of purchase)
- Milestone 2: Distribution (delivery evidence)
- Milestone 3: Final delivery confirmation (impact report, non-sensitive proofs)

---

## Technical Ethos (Commitments)

- Contracts will be **publicly verifiable**.
- We will prioritize **low-cost networks** (e.g., EVM L2s) and **stablecoins**.
- Sensitive beneficiary data will **never** be stored on-chain.
- Offline/low-connectivity realities will be considered from early pilot stages.

## Call for Collaboration

We welcome:
- NGOs interested in pilot programs
- Developers aligned with open-source humanitarian tech
- Researchers, auditors, and advisors
- Contributors who believe transparency saves lives

If you believe humanitarian aid deserves verifiable trust, you belong here.
